# apk-batch-install
Python script to batch install APK files using ADB USB debugging on Linux.

# Usage
* Make it executable or run it with
`python adb-install.py`
* Connect your Android device with USB Debugging turned ON.
* Make sure ADB is installed on your Computer and is in the PATH.
* Run it.

PS : It doesn't take any argument. It just installs every APK in it's path. So make sure to put
all your apps in a single directory and ensure no shady apps are in the directory.
Split-APKs are not supported... I think. 

I made it only to make the Installation of extensions for Tachiyomi and Changing Custom ROMs easier.
